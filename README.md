# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

This repository contains learning material and implementations related to *unsupervised learning algorithms* in machine learning. The focus is on clustering techniques, which help group data based on patterns and similarities without labeled outputs.

These algorithms are widely used in real-world applications such as customer segmentation, pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and data exploration.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- *K-Means Clustering*  
  An iterative algorithm that partitions data into clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It's one of the most popular clustering methods used in various fields.

- *Mall Customers Prediction using K-Means Clustering*  
  A case study on how clustering can be applied to customer segmentation, helping businesses target different groups based on purchasing behavior.

- *Hierarchical Clustering â€“ Agglomerative & Divisive*  
  Techniques that build nested clusters either by merging smaller clusters (agglomerative) or by splitting larger clusters (divisive), useful for understanding hierarchical relationships in data.

- *DBSCAN Spatial Clustering*  
  A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters of varying shapes and sizes, and can handle noise in the data effectively.

- *Mall Customers Prediction using Hierarchical Clustering*  
  Another case study demonstrating how hierarchical clustering techniques can be applied for customer segmentation and business insights.
